    <h2>First, the basics.</h2>

    You need the following to build your website.

    <div class="section_1">
        <ul>
            <li>HTML and CSS</li>
            <li>Javascript</li>
            <li>Node.js</li>
            <li>And other web development frameworks</li>
        </ul>

        You should list your top 3 goals for the class below.
        <ol>
            <li> Learn front-end web design
            <li> Learn new programming languages
            <li> Learn how to work with others in a technical space
            <li> Learn popular web dev frameworks
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="section_2">
        <h2>Let's Try Some Inline Elements</h2>

        <p class="subtitle"> you want to <em>draw attention to something</em> in a line of text.</p>

        <p class="subtitle">Sometimes you want to <strong>strongly emphasize something</strong> in the text.</p>

        <p class="subtitle">Sometimes you want to <strong><em>do both.</em></p></strong>
    </div>

    <strong class="subtitle">Empty Elements</strong>
    <br>
    line breaks can't wrap anything.<br> 
    Neither can image tags, or hard lines.<br>
    Add a hard line under here, and make sure you've used some soft line breaks to match your page to the sample.

    <div class="section_3">
        Images 
        Don't forget to use alt text on your images. It's important for accessibility.
        If you build this page right, your images will form a small "carousel"
    </div>
